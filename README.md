LaunchyAdvisor is an intelligent assistant designed to simulate a team of business domain experts helping startups evaluate strategic questions â€” such as launching a new product in a specific region.

This application uses a modular architecture where each expert agent provides insights in a specific area (Budget, Legal, and Marketing), coordinated by an Orchestrator Agent.
